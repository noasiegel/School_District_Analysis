# School_District_Analysis

##Discoveries made

A few discoveries I made while performing my analysis included searching for more ways than we
learned in the module to get to the solution that was asked of us. This included using slightly different syntax
while I sorted the data, grouped the data and averaged the data. 

I also discovered that this dataset is slightly different than the dataset that was used in the
modeule examples. This helped me understand that its always important
to look at your data and understand the numbers you are seeing to make sure you are digesting what you are seeing.

In terms of the data itself, from the dataframes we uncovered, charter schools produce a slightly higher average
math score than public schools, despite public schools recieving more budget. Additionally, 9th graders have the
highest average math score of all grades, across both charter and public schools.
